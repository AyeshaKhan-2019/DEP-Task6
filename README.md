Task 6: Creating a Single-Page Application (SPA) for a Random Quote Generator      
The task is to develop a dynamic SPA that displays random quotes without page reloads.

Styling is added to create a visually appealing interface while ensuring cross-browser compatibility and also that it renders well across different devices.
